# Salut! 👋

I break things professionally (before bad actors do), then automate the fixes. Lead SRE Security Engineer who believes infrastructure should be both bulletproof *and* elegant.

## What I Actually Do

I'm the person who says "mais non, we can't just YOLO to production" and then shows you how to do it safely with zero-trust architecture and proper secrets management. Think of me as the friendly neighborhood security guy who also happens to love Kubernetes chaos engineering.

### 🔐 Security Stuff (the serious part)

**Making Things Secure** 🛡️
- Infrastructure hardening (because "it works on my machine" isn't a security strategy)
- Secrets management with hardware keys (SOPS, Vault, and my beloved Yubikeys)
- Zero Trust - because trust is for friends, not for networks
- Security automation - if I have to do it twice, it gets a script
- Compliance things (SOC2, ISO 27001) - the necessary evil

**SRE Things** ⚙️
- Kubernetes wrangling (CKA, CKAD, CKS - collected them all like Pokémon cards)
- Cloud stuff across AWS, GCP, Azure (poly-cloud life chose me)
- IaC with Terraform - because clicking in consoles is *so* 2015
- Making things observable (Prometheus, Grafana, ELK)
- On-call duty - my love-hate relationship with PagerDuty

**DevSecOps** 🔄
- Shifting security left (before it's too expensive to fix)
- Container security - because `FROM ubuntu:latest` gives me nightmares
- CI/CD pipeline security - your build server is not a trusted environment
- Supply chain security - trust but verify *everything*

### 🛠️ My Toolbox

**Security Arsenal**
```
Yubikey | SOPS | Vault | Falco | Trivy | OPA | Kyverno
```

**Infrastructure**
```
Kubernetes | Docker | Terraform | Ansible | ArgoCD | Helm
```

**Clouds** ☁️
```
AWS (my main squeeze) | GCP (the side project) | Azure (it's complicated)
```

**Languages**
```
Go | Python | Bash | Ruby | HCL | YAML (yes, YAML is a language, fight me)
```

### 🚀 Recent Work

**[SOPS + Yubikey PIV](https://github.com/shamil2/sops-yubikey)**

Because storing secrets in plaintext is a crime against humanity. This setup uses hardware-backed Yubikey PIV keys with physical touch requirement - if malware tries to decrypt your secrets, your Yubikey LED blinks and you know something's fishy.

*C'est magnifique* - your secrets are safe, your team is happy, and attackers are frustrated. Exactement what we want.

### 💭 Philosophy

> *"Security without usability is just expensive theater. Good security makes the secure path the easy path."*

Also:
- Automate everything (humans are terrible at repetitive tasks)
- Monitor everything (you can't improve what you don't measure)
- Break things in staging (so they don't break in prod)
- Document everything (future-you will thank present-you)

### 🎯 Currently Tinkering With

- 🔐 Hardware security keys & zero-trust implementations (obsessed with Yubikeys)
- ☸️ Kubernetes runtime security (Falco is my spirit animal)
- 🔄 GitOps security workflows (because Git is the source of truth)
- 🛡️ Supply chain security (trust no dependency)
- 📊 Security observability (finding needles in haystacks, but make it automated)

### 🏆 Certifications

☸️ Kubernetes trilogy (CKA, CKAD, CKS)
☁️ AWS Solutions Architect + Security Specialty
🔐 CISSP (the one that makes recruiters happy)
🚀 Site Reliability Engineering principles (learned from production incidents)

### 📫 Contact

- GitHub: right here, you found me
- Email: shamil.ghaseeta@s3ns.io
- Best way: open an issue on my repos (I'm more responsive than on email)

### ⚡ Fun Facts

- I have more Yubikeys than most people have regular keys
- My idea of a good time is hardening a Kubernetes cluster
- I speak fluent YAML (unfortunately)
- Coffee-to-code ratio: 1:1
- *"Have you tried turning it off and on again?"* is a valid security strategy

PS: If you're here from a security audit, yes, I practice what I preach. Check out my repos - actual working code, not just slides.

Bisous! 💜
